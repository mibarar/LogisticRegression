# Logistic Regression
Development of a logistic regression from scratch in Python.

This project was developed for the final exam of my course [Math Concepts for Developers 2020](https://softuni.bg/trainings/2778/math-concepts-for-developers-february-2020), taught at [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/) by Yordan Darakchiev. 

This was my first real experiense with Machine Learning. The project is presented as it was made at the time, though from the point view of a more experienced Data Scientist now, I see many details that should be corrected/improved.
