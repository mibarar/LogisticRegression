# Logistic Regression
Development of a logistic regression from scratch in Python.

This project was developed for the final exam of my course "Math Concepts for Developers 2020" (https://softuni.bg/trainings/2778/math-concepts-for-developers-february-2020), taught at SoftUni (https://softuni.bg/) by Yordan Darakchiev. 

This was my first real experiense with Machine Learning.
